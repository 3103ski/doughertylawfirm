						<HeaderText>diagnosis and treatment of a skull fracture</HeaderText>
						<Paragraph>
							Generally, skull fractures are diagnosed when a patient undergoes computed tomography (CT) testing. A CT scan is more reliable for diagnosing a skull fracture than is
							magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI is better suited to diagnose traumatic brain injuries. Some skull fractures do not require the assistance of imaging for a
							diagnosis as the fracture is quite evident by visual and physical examination.
						</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>
							Skull fractures by their very nature accompany traumatic brain injuries. The skulls is the structure that houses and protects the brain from injury. Therefore, fracturing
							of the skull can be a very serious medical condition. In many circumstances a person that experiences a skull fracture may undergo brain surgery.
